## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Necessary libraries to run the code include: @@@.  The code has been run on Python 3.8.

## Goals of the Project<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to use the Seattle Airbnb Open data to determine:

What should an investor know when looking to buy a Seattle apartment that they will rent out on Airbnb?
1. Which zip codes in the Seattle area are associated with higher apartment rent prices?
2. Does "super host" status influence allow an owner to charge more for their apartment, and should the investor try and become one?
3. What are some of the key contributing factors that "super hosts" have, and what should our investor aim to do to become one?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

@@@ Jupyter notebook file XYZ.ipynb includes the code that was used to analyze the Seattle Airbnb data set.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Seattle Airbnb is the owner of the data used.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download).
As for my personal code, you can use it to your heart's content!
