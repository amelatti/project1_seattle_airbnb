## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Necessary libraries to run the code include: @@@.  The code has been run on Python 3.8.

## Goals of the Project<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to use the Seattle Airbnb Open data to determine:

What should a first-time Seattle Airbnb owner expect?
1. Does price of an airbnb influence how often it is booked?
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

@@@ Jupyter notebook file XYZ.ipynb includes the code that was used to analyze the Seattle Airbnb data set.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Seattle Airbnb is the owner of the data used.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download).
As for my personal code, you can use it to your heart's content!
